# Project-2: Instagram user Analytics Report.
## Project Description:
<p>In the given assignment, we must present a thorough report to Instagram's product team; the management need certain critical insights from the user schema that will be vital in driving increased user engagement for Instagram. Multiple teams will utilise the conclusions produced from the analysis for launch marketing campaigns, decide on new features for designing an app, measure the performance of the app by evaluating user engagement, and enhance the overall experience while also securing business growth.</p>
<p>The Instagram user Analytics project will focus on producing insights using SQL as the primary analytical tool. Loading the schema in the MySQL server takes the first priority.</p>

## ‚úçüèº Approach:
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Creating a Database](https://github.com/Subhrajit91939/MySQL-Projects/edit/main/Trainity-SQL-DataAnalystProjects/Solution_Report.md#resources)<br>
```sql
-- Selecting the `ig_clone` database.
SHOW DATABASES;
USE ig_clone;
```
Verifying if all the tables have been created properly (or) not.

```sql
mysql> SHOW TABLES; 
+--------------------+
| Tables_in_ig_clone |
+--------------------+
| comments           |
| follows            |
| likes              |
| photo_tags         |
| photos             |
| tags               |
| users              |
+--------------------+
7 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The marketing team wants to launch some campaigns, and they need help with determining the following:
#### Q1. Rewarding Most Loyal Users: People who have been using the platform for the longest time.
      *Task:* Find the 5 oldest users of the Instagram from the database provided.
We use the `users` table to retrieve the data as it contains the users id, username and their joining date which is required for sorting the table and retrieving the 
oldest users of Instagram from the database.
```sql
SELECT
        id AS 'User-ID',
        username AS 'Username',
        created_at AS 'Joined Instagram on'
        -- Selecting the id, username and the created_at columns with proper aliasing.
FROM users
ORDER BY created_at ASC 
-- Sorting the users with respect to the created_at column using the `ORDER BY` clause in the ascending order.
LIMIT 5; -- As we need only the First 5 users for instagram, we use the `LIMIT` clause
```
```sql
mysql> source insta_task.sql
+---------+------------------+---------------------+
| User-ID | Username         | Joined Instagram on |
+---------+------------------+---------------------+
|      80 | Darby_Herzog     | 2016-05-06 00:14:21 |

|      38 | Jordyn.Jacobson2 | 2016-05-14 07:56:26 |
+---------+------------------+---------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
#### Q2. Remind Inactive Users to Start Posting: By sending them promotional emails to post their 1st photo.
     *Task:* Find the users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.
     
```sql
SELECT 
        users.id AS 'User-ID',
        users.username AS 'Users'
FROM users
WHERE users.id NOT IN (SELECT photos.user_id FROM photos);
```
```sql
mysql> source insta_task.sql

#### Q3. Declaring Contest Winner: The team started a contest and the user who gets the most likes on a single photo will win the contest now they wish to declare the winner.
     *Task:* Identify the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team.
```sql

        photos.user_id AS 'UserId',
        users.username AS 'Username',
        COUNT(likes.photo_id) AS 'No. of Likes'
FROM likes
JOIN photos ON likes.photo_id = photos.id
JOIN users ON photos.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY likes.photo_id
ORDER BY COUNT(likes.photo_id) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
```sql
mysql> source insta_task.sql
